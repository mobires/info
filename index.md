# Welcome<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

Welcome to the Mobile System Usage Study information page!

# Purpose<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

To study application’s system activities in mobile devices

# Description<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

When people use mobile applications on smartphones or tablets, the performance of the system (including storage use and latency) is affected by factors such as the user’s application usage pa먭꾧erns and the design and implementation of the application and the operating system; however, there is no relevant literature on uncovering these complex system behaviors in today’s increasingly cloud‐ integrated mobile ecosystem. In this study, we deploy an monitoring application to a diverse population of users, with different access pa먭꾧erns, and collect data storage‐related system behaviors over the space of several months: e.g., storage use over time, application access data, etc. We will use these data to identify the behavior of mobile applications in the existing system and lay the groundwork to guide systems researchers as well as the industry on designing mobile storage systems that fit the needs of cloud storage‐enabled environments.

# Duration<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

Once the monitoring application is deployed, it will run in the background and in a non‐intrusive fashion to collect mobile application usage data for a time period ranging from one month to several months.

# Risks and Benefits to Study Participants<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

Risks to subjects are minimal. The monitoring application may add a minor overhead to a user’s daily application use. The data we collect are generally by their nature not user‐identifiable: e.g., the storage system’s trace, including storage usage and filenames. In cases in which a user or an application intentionally uses user‐identifiable information such as the user’s name or email address, this information will be encoded by means of a cryptographic function such as SHA256 so that it will no longer be user‐identifiable.
Participants will get no benefits or incentives based on the collected data range is minimal. When the collected data type is a type of system tracing that requires resulting more overhead, we will provide a gift card as an incentive.
